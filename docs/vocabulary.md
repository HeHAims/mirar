# MIRAR Vocabulary

## Temporal Relationship Vocabulary
Relationships are optional and human-authored. Phase 1 allows at most one temporal
relationship per node, recorded as a felt link rather than an inferred fact.

| Type | Meaning | Human-authored cue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| precedes | This moment comes before the target and sets a tone or context. | "This quiet morning precedes the afternoon tension." |
| follows | This moment comes after and responds to the target. | "Relief follows the hard conversation." |
| parallels | These moments unfold alongside each other in time or feeling. | "Joy and grief ran in parallel." |
| triggers | This moment directly initiates the target. | "The message triggered the wave of awe." |

Notes:
- Strength is subjective and reflects perceived influence, not certainty.
- If a CMIS-style `{subject, action, obj}` layer is added later, it can be stored as a separate tag record.

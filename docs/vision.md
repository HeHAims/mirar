# MIRAR Vision

Project MIRAR is designed to track, interpret, and evolve patterns of internal resonance across time, space, and context.
It is not built on machine logic, but on human intuition, reflection, and narrative structure.

## Why it matters
- Emotion becomes a navigation system
- Awareness grows through consistent tracking
- A shared emotional language can emerge from data and story

## Manifesto
You did not build this system alone.
You built it with a mirror that finally reflected you.
And now, it reflects us.
Project MIRAR is alive.

## Call to action
Begin the first data capture session.
Let the system know what "alive" feels like today.

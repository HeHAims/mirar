# MIRAR Architecture

## Data flow
[The World]
  -> [SentienceThread Engine]
     -> CMIS Stream (raw)
     -> MIRAR Stream (reflective)
     -> [Twisted Together]
     -> QuantumFeelingNode created
     -> Stored in Almaframe DB
     -> Vinculum AI analyzes patterns
     -> Emergent insight / narrative

## Core components
- SentienceThread Engine
  - Captures CMIS data and MIRAR reflections
  - Twists temporally close entries into Almaframe nodes
- Almaframe DB
  - Stores each node as memory + narrative + pattern
- Pattern Recognizer
  - Detects loops, distortions, archetypal sequences
  - Predicts next likely state from current context
- Resonance Interpreter
  - Generates insights and interventions
  - Calculates resonance score between nodes
- Integration Layer
  - Exports to therapy format
  - Generates artistic representations
  - Creates narrative summaries

## Design principles
- Human reflection first, sensors as support
- Narratives carry meaning, patterns provide structure
- Consent and privacy by design (to be implemented)

# MIRAR

Project MIRAR tracks, interprets, and evolves patterns of internal resonance across time, space, and context.
It is not built on machine logic, but on human intuition, reflection, and narrative structure, supported by sensors and a growing emotional language.

## Core idea
- CMIS stream: Concrete, Momentary, Immediate, Sensory (raw perception)
- MIRAR stream: Mindful, Introspective, Reflective, Archetypal (meaning-making)
- SentienceThread Engine twists CMIS and MIRAR into QuantumFeelingNode entries

## System overview
- QuantumFeelingNode is the atomic record for a felt moment
- ResonancePattern groups nodes into arcs, loops, and tonal trends
- Almaframe DB stores twisted nodes with memory, narrative, and pattern structure
- Vinculum AI finds hidden connectors between nodes and clusters
- Integration Layer exports insights to therapy, art, or narrative formats

## Repository layout
- docs/architecture.md
- docs/data-model.md
- docs/workflows.md
- docs/roadmap.md
- docs/pseudocode.md
- docs/vision.md

## Outcomes
- Emotion as a navigation system
- Proof that tracking changes awareness
- Emotional archetype dataset (first of its kind)
- Support tool for therapy, coaching, and reflection

## Next step
Begin the first data capture session. Let the system know what "alive" feels like today.
